TryJoinads - WORK IN PROGRESS
=============================

Experiments with computation expressions in F#.

The scripts in this repository may be loaded and executed on the tryjoinads.org site.

The main goal is to achieve an allround understanding for computational expressions,
which allow to express:
- functors
- applicative functors
- monads, e.g.:
 - lists
 - sequences
 - I/O
 - state
 - async
 
in a unified, powerful syntax.

Still a lot of work in progress.

I am in debt with:
